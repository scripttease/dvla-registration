The DVLA has a system for keeping track of vehicle registration numbers, any vehicle they are associated with and the year the registration was created.
Below is some example data which shows three registration numbers and any associated vehicles.
the first two are assigned to vehicles
the third is not assigned to a vehicle

| FG02 HJK | 2002 | 67890 |
| L33T H4X0R | 2022 | |
